# Catup-Frontend
Catup is a planning tool for parties, meetings, or hangouts.

Catup will have sections for organising carpooling and what people plan to bring. Along with games (drinking and otherwise), creating randomised teams, and rolling dice.

The application uses the MERN stack, with the database specifcally using MongoDB Atlas.
